# Project Memory

Running context for this repo, kept in-repo so it survives conversation compaction/resets.
Update this as decisions get made — treat it as the source of truth alongside
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

## Vision

alexanderwebber.com is Alexander Webber's personal site: a warm, data-rich home for his running
(progress, targets, races, charity fundraising, PBs, videos, training/health/performance
metrics), and a professional CV & AI/software-engineering blog that opens future job
opportunities. Built spec-first with Spec Kit as a modular site that can grow new sections.

## Phasing

1. **Running** — first feature. Garmin-driven stats, races & PBs, targets, charity fundraising
   (Brighton Marathon, 2027-04-04, for Martlets hospice), videos.
2. **CV & Blog** — professional section; AI-drafted, owner-approved content with a living
   `VOICE.md` style guide.
3. **Future sections** — added as self-contained modules (constitution Principle VII).

## Working norms

- Requirements are drawn out by the coding agent asking focused rounds of questions (with
  recommended options), rather than the owner supplying everything up front.
- Research before committing to third-party dependencies — verify maintenance status rather than
  picking from memory (see the Garmin library decision below).
- Spec Kit commands run via the Claude integration with PowerShell scripts; house standards come
  from `speckit-standards` (preset `house-constitution`, extension `house-process`, dev-mode).

## Decisions log

- **2026-10-03** — Repo created: `github.com/alexwebber/alexanderwebber.com`, private for now
  (public/private decision deferred — see `BACKLOG.md`). Bootstrapped with Spec Kit 1.1.0 plus
  house standards.
- **2026-10-03** — Constitution v1.0.0 ratified (8 principles: house I–II plus Own Your Data,
  Pluggable Providers & Storage, Serverless Gracefully Degrading, Privacy by Default, Modular
  Sections, Authentic Voice).
- **2026-10-03** — Architecture direction: ingest → store → render. Scheduled jobs (every 1–3h +
  manual trigger) pull incrementally into versioned JSON files in git, behind a storage
  abstraction; serverless functions allowed; no visitor request depends on a third-party API;
  no logins (admin via git). Why: providers don't serve the aggregates needed, rate-limit, and
  break; owning data keeps the site fast and durable.
- **2026-10-03** — Running data source: Garmin Connect via `cyberjunky/python-garminconnect`
  behind a provider adapter. Why: only route to health/performance metrics (VO2 max, training
  status, weight, HRV) — Strava's API lacks them and its 2024 terms restrict showing data to
  others; Garmin's official API is business-only. Research (2026-10-03): `garth` and
  `garminexport` are deprecated (Garmin auth change); GarminDB and garmin-grafana are apps built
  on python-garminconnect; the Node `garmin-connect` client is stale since 2024.
  python-garminconnect is actively released (0.3.17, 2026-09-29) with its own auth, MFA, and
  auto-refreshing tokens.
- **2026-10-03** — Stack & hosting: TypeScript static-site framework (Astro favoured) on
  Cloudflare Pages/Workers; Python ingest jobs; domain at Namecheap. Cost not a constraint.
- **2026-10-03** — Privacy: public = race results/PBs, training totals, individual runs, health
  and performance metrics; GPS maps for races only, never training runs.
- **2026-10-03** — Build gate from day one (site build + data-schema validation on every push and
  ingest commit); broader CI deferred.

## Open questions

- Can python-garminconnect log in from GitHub Actions' datacenter IPs (Cloudflare blocking is a
  known open issue)? → first spike of the Running plan; fallback is a scheduled sync on the
  owner's PC. Also: how rotated refresh tokens get persisted between unattended runs.
- Which fundraising platform Martlets uses for the Brighton Marathon page (JustGiving, Enthuse,
  own system?) — determines the fundraising provider adapter.
- Weight display: exact values vs trend only — decide during Running spec.
- See `BACKLOG.md` for deferred/future work items.
